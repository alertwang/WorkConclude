<P>            Welcome to the Yocto Project Development Manual!          =
  This=20
manual provides information on how to use the Yocto Project to           =
=20
develop embedded Linux images and user-space applications that           =
 run on=20
targeted devices.            The manual provides an overview of image, =
kernel,=20
and            user-space application development using the Yocto =
Project.      =20
     Because much of the information in this manual is general, it       =
    =20
contains many references to other sources where you can find more        =
   =20
detail.            For example, you can find detailed information on =
Git,=20
repositories,            and open source in general in many places on =
the=20
Internet.            Another example specific to the Yocto Project is =
how to=20

<P>            The Yocto Project Development Manual does, however, =
provide      =20
     guidance and examples on how to change the kernel source code,      =

<P>    This chapter helps you understand the Yocto Project as an open =

development project.    In general, working in an open source =
environment is=20
very different from working in a    closed, proprietary environment.   =20
Additionally, the Yocto Project uses specific tools and constructs as =
part of=20
its development    environment.    This chapter specifically addresses =
open=20
source philosophy, using the    Yocto Project in a team environment, =

<P>        Open source philosophy is characterized by software =

models used by commercial software        companies where a finite set =
of=20
developers produces a product for sale using a defined set        of =
procedures=20
that ultimately result in an end product whose architecture and source =
material =20
      are closed to the public.     </P>
<P>        Open source projects conceptually have differing concurrent =
agendas,=20
approaches, and production.        These facets of the development =
process can=20
come from anyone in the public (community) that has a        stake in =
the=20
software project.        The open source environment contains new =
copyright,=20
licensing, domain, and consumer issues        that differ from the more=20
traditional development environment.        In an open source =
environment, the=20
end product, source material, and documentation are        all available =
to the=20
public at no cost.     </P>
<P>        A benchmark example of an open source project is the Linux =
kernel,=20
which was initially conceived        and created by Finnish computer =
science=20

into multiple layers.            Layers allow you to isolate different =
types of=20
customizations from            each other.            You might find it =
tempting=20
to keep everything in one layer when            working on a single =

<P>            To illustrate how layers are used to keep things modular, =

consider            machine customizations.            These types of=20
customizations typically reside in a special layer,            rather =
than a=20
general layer, called a Board Support Package (BSP)            Layer.    =
       =20
Furthermore, the machine customizations should be isolated from          =
 =20
recipes and Metadata that support a new GUI environment,            for =
example.=20
           This situation gives you a couple of layers: one for the =
machine     =20
      configurations, and one for the GUI environment.            It is=20
important to understand, however, that the BSP layer can            =
still make=20
machine-specific additions to recipes within the GUI            =
environment=20
layer without polluting the GUI layer itself            with those=20
machine-specific changes.            You can accomplish this through a =

<P>                Probably the easiest way to customize an image is to =
add a   =20
            package by way of the <CODE =
class=3D"filename">local.conf</CODE>      =20
         configuration file.                Because it is limited to =
local use,=20
this method generally only                allows you to add packages and =
is not=20
as flexible as creating                your own customized image.        =
       =20
When you add packages using local variables this way, you need           =
     to=20
realize that these variable changes are in effect for every              =
  build=20
and consequently affect all images, which might not                be =
what you=20
require.             </P>
<P>                To add a package to your image using the local =
configuration =20
              file, use the                 <CODE class=3D"filename"><A =

<P>                Use of the syntax is important - specifically, the =

      =20
<CODE class=3D"filename">strace</CODE> in this example.                =
This space=20

   =20
operator does not add the space.             </P>
<P>                Furthermore, you must use <CODE=20
class=3D"filename">_append</CODE> instead                of the <CODE =

    The=20
reason for this is because doing so unconditionally appends              =

affect.             </P>

<P>                    Sometimes, you need to add pre-compiled binaries =
to an   =20
                image.                    For example, suppose that =
binaries for=20
proprietary code                    exist, which are created by a =
particular=20
division of a                    company.                    Your part =
of the=20
company needs to use those binaries as                    part of an =
image that=20
you are building using the                    OpenEmbedded build system. =
       =20
           Since you only have the binaries and not the source code,     =
       =20
       you cannot use a typical recipe that expects to fetch the         =
       =20
   source specified in                     <A class=3D"ulink" =

      and=20
then compile it.                 </P>
<P>                    One method is to package the binaries and then =
install=20
them                    as part of the image.                    =
Generally, it=20
is not a good idea to package binaries                    since, among =
other=20
things, it can hinder the ability to                    reproduce builds =
and=20
could lead to compatibility problems                    with ABI in the =

<P>                    The easiest solution is to create a recipe that =

<P>        QEMU is made available with the Yocto Project a number of =
ways.      =20
